The BMP file format, or bitmap, is a [raster graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_graphics) image file format used to store bitmap [digital images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_image), independently of the display device (such as a graphics adapter), especially on Microsoft Windows and OS/2 operating systems.

The BMP file format is capable of storing [two-dimensional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2D_computer_graphics) digital images in various color depths, and optionally with data compression, alpha channels, and [color profiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_management). The [Windows Metafile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Metafile) (WMF) specification covers the BMP file format.

A color spectrum image with an alpha channel that falls off to zero at its base, where it is blended with the background color..

In computer graphics, alpha compositing or alpha blending is the process of combining one image with a background to create the appearance of partial or full [transparency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(graphic)). It is often useful to render [picture elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel) (pixels) in separate passes or layers and then combine the resulting 2D images into a single, final image called the composite. Compositing is used extensively in film when combining computer-rendered image elements with live footage. Alpha blending is also used in 2D computer graphics to put [rasterized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasterisation) foreground elements over a background.
